# MeetApp

MeetApp is a progressive web application (PWA) built using React and a serverless architecture. The app fetches upcoming events from Google Calendar API and allows users to filter events by city, show/hide event details, and specify the number of events they want to view. MeetApp also functions offline and was developed using a test-driven development (TDD) technique.

## Features

1. Filter events by City
    - Users can filter events based on their city of choice, making it easier to find events happening near them

2. Show/ Hide an Evenâ€™s details
    - Users have the option to toggle between showing and hiding event details, allowing them to view more or less information about an event.

3. Specify Number of Events
    - User can choose the number of events they want to see in the app at once.

4. Use the App when Offline
    - MeetApp works even when offline, allowing users to view events they previosuly viewed while online.

5. Data Visualization
    - The app provides a chart displaying upcoming events in each city, helping users see what events are happening where.

6. Add an app Shortcut to the home screen
    - MeetApp provides the choice to add a shortcut to the home screen, making it easier to quickly access the app.

## My Role and Tasks

My responsibility was to translate the user stories into features, breaking down each feature into sub-features, and testing them using a combination of Jest, Enzyme, and Puppeteer. This was my first time working with TDD and BDD techniques and testing libraries like Jest and Enzyme.

## Lessons Learned

Working on MeetApp was an incredible learning opportunity. I gained practical experience in transforming user stories into features, utilizing testing libraries, and applying TDD and BDD techniques to build a reliable application. I am confident that the skills I acquired will be beneficial in future projects.
